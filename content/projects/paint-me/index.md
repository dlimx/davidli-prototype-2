This webapp uses machine learning to generate works of art from user-submitted photos. A few select pieces of art were selected, and the styles, patterns and designs were extracted using a neural network built in TensorFlow.

The technique of style transfer is utilized to apply the learned styles to user photos, molding the photo according to the principles of the famous pieces of art.

Recommendation: try it out using a well-textured photo (one that's more complex than simple colors)!

Built in collaboration with Gabriel Alacchi, Robert Fratila, and Alice Scott.
