A (perhaps slightly over-engineered) personal website and blog. Designed and built with minimalistic and responsive principles in mind, it presents a clean, modern interface that works beautifully in desktop and mobile. React was used to create the front-end, and node.js for the backend.

The site was designed as a Single Page Application - meaning refreshes are nonexistent, providing users with a smooth and speedy experience. The site takes advantage of universal javascript principles - most notably server-side rendering, allowing proper functionality with JavaScript disabled and direct navigation to subdirectories. The blog is served from a series of flat Markdown files.
