It was something for me to look at, something to keep me going, to keep me inspired to do great things.</p>\n<p>I was, and still am, in a state of discovery - finding myself, my passions, my goals. I think it’s a bit more clear now. There’s a few things that I want to do with life, and a few areas I’m particularly interested and passionate about - the future of humanity, education, technology, politics, and (perhaps most importantly) people. I’m still figuring things out, but I think I have more of an idea of what to do, and the first steps I need to take.</p>\n<p>I hope it can be a (cheesy) source of inspiration and motivation to you, just like all the statuses I (used to) post.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Dear [Me],</p>\n<p>I know you’ve been feeling down. I know sometimes things seem impossible, and there are no good choices. I know you’ve failed a few times. I know you keep trying, but each time it seems hopeless. I know it feels like time is running out, and opportunities are slipping away.</p>\n<p>But, despite all these challenges, I hope you don’t stop trying.</p>\n<p>I hope every time you fall, you find the strength to pick yourself up again. And when you no longer have that strength, I hope you reach out for help.</p>\n<p>You should be proud of what you have accomplished. You’ve come so far, graduated university, and have had great experiences. You have beautiful, inspirational friends, who care and think about you. You’re a brilliant and passionate individual, with so much potential.</p>\n<p>Yet you and I both know you have not realised that potential.</p>\n<p>So stay hungry.</p>\n<p>You have the potential, so work hard for it.</p>\n<p>There’s so much more in this world to see, so much for you to experience.</p>\n<p>All of the wonders of the universe, of humanity, are out there, waiting. You just need to reach out and seize it. You have everything to lose, the endless bounty of the future.</p>\n<p>But you also have so much to gain.</p>\n<p>You know how hard it’s been, and how hard it will be. But I know you - you hunger, you lust.</p>\n<p>So please, find courage. Faith. Hope.</p>\n<p>Courage to face your fears and anxiety, and overcome them.</p>\n<p>Faith in yourself, that you can find the strength to do what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>Hope, for a better world - one made possible by you.</p>\n<p>Please, just try.</p>\n<p>I know you will.</p>\n<p>And one day, I’ll be very, very, proud.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Me.</p>\n<p>I hope you too, can reach your dreams, and change the world. It can’t be that hard, can it?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Open Letter","date":"November 01, 2016","tags":["self"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/open-letter/","previous":{"collection":"posts","fields":{"slug":"/promise-of-potential/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Promise of Potential","tags":["self"]}},"next":{"collection":"posts","fields":{"slug":"/election-2016/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Election 2016","tags":["self","news"]}}}}}
