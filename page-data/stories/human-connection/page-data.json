In many ways, it’s been quite lonely. To many of you, I’ve missed you so much. Nonetheless, the region has wonderful people, but it can be a challenge to find and connect with them. I’m sure it’s something that’ll come with time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/YrJ5EvZ.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Friends (a)\"></p>\n<p>I know this is the most common thing to say, but thank you all so much, once again. Those of you, my friends and colleagues, have helped make life a much better place for me.</p>\n<p>One of the funnier things that’s happened throughout these last years, and one of the biggest changes to me, is how much I value and am affected by others.</p>\n<p>When I first immigrated to Canada, and for quite a long time after, I was freakishly scared of meeting new people and of talking to friends. I remember asking my parents to do so much for me, from asking for condiments from waitresses (lol) to consciously choosing to avoid what friends I did have.</p>\n<p>And these supplemented my various hobbies, most notably that of gaming. I still game (a bit), but never to quite the same degree of social avoidance.\nHad I not been able to (or had I not met people who could get me to) meet some of you, how boring and lonely my life would have been.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I think I’m still dealing with some of these issues still. I know for myself that it is so difficult to admit mistakes, and to ask for both help and forgiveness. Perhaps especially the help. Part of that can be attributed to pride, but another part to the fear of rejection.</p>\n<p>I know how hard I agonized over asking professors for letters of recommendation. Over asking a girl out. Over asking for opportunities.</p>\n<p>I think I’ve recognized some of these barriers. The fear of failure, and of keeping the potential and the hope alive, was so real. It’s so much easier just to never try, to never give it your all, and just say that “Don’t worry, I can do it, I just need to find the right moment.” That’s probably a longer topic.</p>\n<p>I also know that I’m a really cocky individual. I definitely resort to teasing, to trash-talking, etc., in social situations. Sometimes it’s for fun. Other times its a little bit defensive, to make sure no one knows my weaknesses, and to deflect anything that might harm me or force me to think and talk about things I’m scared of.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the friends who showed me the beauty of humanity.</p>\n<p>And thank you to the friends who cared enough to break down my walls.</p>\n<p>Some things have gotten better. I think I’m much better at opening up to friends, and at making new meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>Other things still need work. Maybe a cocky attitude needs to be toned down. Maybe a few innate defenses still need to be overcome. I definitely still need to be able to talk to certain people better. And maybe to be a bit more appropriate and mature.</p>\n<p>I could blame it on society, on the attitudes of coldness and of image, on the need to maintain a facade of strength. We’ve seen the books and stories lamenting the attitudes of modern society, blaming sources from advertisement to feminism for creating what some term a generation of meaningless and superficial people. But we can all change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/qUXWQQW.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Friends (b)\"></p>\n<p>I think opening up to each other is one of the most beautiful things of friendship and love.</p>\n<p>The trust, the understanding, the acceptance, and the human touch are things that we can’t simply emulate, but require this deeper connection between each other.</p>\n<p>In many ways, this support has been invaluable.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To amp the cheesiness factor to 11, but to try and be serious, friendship has definitely been something that changed my life.</p>\n<p>I’ve said this before, and I’ll say this again: I would’ve never made it this far without your friendship and love.</p>\n<p>Having you guys to talk to, to confess to, to trust in, is something that I can rely on even when I can’t continue on.</p>\n<p>How lonely it would be without.</p>\n<p>The support, the care, the love, is something that I will always treasure.</p>\n<p>Being able to reach out, and have someone listen, someone to offer advice and company, and someone to be a shoulder to cry on, is something that will always reassure me. I know that someone will be there to catch me when I fall.</p>\n<p>Talking about dreams, inspiring one another, and pushing each other to new heights is another that I will need, heading into an uncertain future. But some of these conversations, some of these debates, are what drive me and what ignites a small spark in my heart.</p>\n<p>And being there for others, being able to understand, and to help, has allowed me to realize that that is one of my deepest passions.</p>\n<p>It’s also been so amazing to know that others feel similarly. To summarize my feelings with a quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Friendship … is born at the moment when one man says to another ‘What! You too? I thought that no one but myself…‘”\n<strong>C. S. Lewis</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>So, thanks for all of the parties. For making life brighter and happier, and full of excitement.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the conversations. For giving life emotion and meaning.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the dinners. For giving life vibrancy and wisdom, and companionship.</p>\n<p>And thanks for all the things that I can’t fit in a few sentences, for giving life both a past and a future.</p>\n<p>This is my promise: to keep in touch, and to stay in each others lives.</p>\n<p>If you’re reading this, and are ever in Toronto, please reach out. I’d love to catch up.</p>\n<p>If you ever need someone to talk to, I’ll be there.</p>\n<p>I’m going to steal a campaign slogan, but truly, we will be stronger together.</p>\n<p>And please, let me say hi :)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>With love.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Life: the Human Connection","date":"October 11, 2016","tags":["self"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/human-connection/","previous":{"collection":"posts","fields":{"slug":"/new-beginning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A New Beginning","tags":["self"]}},"next":{"collection":"posts","fields":{"slug":"/promise-of-potential/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Promise of Potential","tags":["self"]}}}}}
