I figure that these establish some of my failures and where I come from, and probably serve as a good backdrop. Hopefully the next posts are just fun, interesting, quirky, and growth-minded.</p>\n<p>This is also fairly cocky, but oh well…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I’ve always been smart.</p>\n<p>From a young age, everyone’s told me “Oh you’re so smart”, “You’re so bright”, and so on.</p>\n<p>And even from a young age, I can’t say that that wasn’t supported. I never needed to try much, and when I did more, I always succeeded.</p>\n<p>Everything came fairly easily to me, I picked up talents and new skills quickly. I grasped difficul things with ease. From learning to sight-read piano, to orienting myself in a new environment, to understanding 2D and 3D NMR, I was never truly out of my depth.</p>\n<p>People have all said I have potential - but to me, I still haven’t realized it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I remember going back to China for the second half of Grade 2. As a little sort of background, even in public elementary schools, the Chinese system requires entrance examinations. I did not test well, being placed in what was probably a third-rate school. But I transfered a few weeks in, and by the end of the year I was one of the top scorers at one of the the top schools in the city.</p>\n<p>Even in other things, I tended to be good to great, and mostly without trying.</p>\n<p>This pattern continued through high school, and well into university.</p>\n<p>However, there were finally people who could beat me.</p>\n<p>I didn’t have the highest grades, or the most involvement, or the biggest achievements, but I felt fine about it.</p>\n<p>I mean, I still did decent. More than decent for most people.</p>\n<p>But regardless, I never took the time to be the best. I definitely spent the least time out of anyone who did as well, and I prided myself on that.</p>\n<p>I remember some of my friends who worked so hard, and sure they did better. But I was never far behind. I remember thinking, damn, so much time for just that tiny amount? What a waste of time.</p>\n<p>Looking back, how wrong I was..</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I remember most of my failures, and my successes as well.</p>\n<p>I always used to justify my failures with these successes, and with the “certain” knowledge that - if i had tried - they would’ve been successes too.</p>\n<p>But even my successes never involved much trying.</p>\n<p>I could list some of my accomplishments here.</p>\n<p>41 on the MCAT. 2370 on the SAT. 100th percentile scores, and without much studying. I maybe studied for each for about a week or two, hardly the intensive months-long studying that many use. And I used this to justify my cockiness, my absolute certainty that I was better, that I was smarter, and that I could do whatever.</p>\n<p>Even in university, I had a decent GPA (3.85ish). While many of my friends had higher, most studied so much harder, and I noticed. I could always delude myself, that 4.0 wasn’t that different from my GPA, that their accomplishments were only a little bit better. In the end, it wouldn’t matter, would it?</p>\n<p>And maybe I was right, maybe these small changes, individually, wouldn’t matter. Maybe if you added them all up, it would. Or maybe, the reason, the why, that these were different - that mattered the most.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I remember getting my final rejection letter from the top US colleges.</p>\n<p>I can’t even pretend it didn’t hurt - it hurt a lot. To my pride, my ego, my confidence, and my belief in myself.</p>\n<p>But pretty soon, I was okay with it. I mean, I hadn’t tried that hard.</p>\n<p>My excuses, I had thought, were all valid. I had skipped Early Action. I had finished on basically the very last day. I hadn’t put that much effort into it. And the worst - that it didn’t matter that much. Life goes on, right? McGill or Berkeley would be almost just as good, what’s the big deal?</p>\n<p>And again, maybe these small differences didn’t matter - but the attitude behind it did.</p>\n<p>Because, three years later, the same thing happened again.</p>\n<p>I wavered, I defended my actions, I applied to medical school, but not really trying to, and once again, I was left with a bunch of rejection letters.</p>\n<p>And just like my marks, my various accomplishments, applying to jobs, succeeding in relationships, and so forth, not trying kept me safe.</p>\n<p>In that little bubble of passivity and self-excusement, I could always maintain the belief that I was fine. It was comfortable, I could do enough, and my worldview would never be challenged, my barriers never be shattered.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I thought that if I never tried, I could keep believing - that when I <strong>did</strong> try, I would easily succeed.</p>\n<p>Moments came and passed, and I never could.</p>\n<p>I kept waiting for that one moment, that one day, that one dream, that would finally drive me to try and do everything I ever wanted.</p>\n<p>Now, I think, I better understand.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Trying and discipline is part of how you become stronger.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I’d be content, just living life as it is right now. Having a mediocre life, never really stepping outside my comfort zone, is okay. It’s comfortable, it’s warm - and it’s slowly suffocating me.</p>\n<p>If I never try, if I never strive, and never give something 110%, I’ll never know what it’s like to truly succeed, or to truly fail. I’ll never live, and I don’t think - if I do manage to achieve anything - it’ll be as worthwhile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.\n<strong>Calvin Coolidge</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe I’m missing something. A passion, a clear goal, a dream. A realization that this is all I have. An acceptance that my dreams will never find it’s way to me - I have to do the searching.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’m taking the year to really figure that out.</p>\n<p>I will try, to try.</p>\n<p>My dream hasn’t changed - to change the world.</p>\n<p>I know that I might not reach it, but I will try my best to.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>With love.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Promise of Potential","date":"October 18, 2016","tags":["self"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/promise-of-potential/","previous":{"collection":"posts","fields":{"slug":"/human-connection/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Life: the Human Connection","tags":["self"]}},"next":{"collection":"posts","fields":{"slug":"/open-letter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An Open Letter","tags":["self"]}}}}}
