                I have been learning how to code. I started with Java, followed
                by mostly web-design related applications of HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. I'm getting into React Native and Cordova, so I'm
                hoping to have something for mobile.

                This site is the implementation of my food an travel blog, with
                the actual blog found under "Stories". I have been spending time
                learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., to design and build this
                website. I will follow up with the beginnings of a blog soon.
                The first post was posted (2016/09/20), though I am still in the
                process of sorting the blog out. Posts will be bi-weekly,
                hopefully, and will include random thoughts, travel, lifestyle,
                reviews, plans, etc., and will hopefully be a reflection of
                life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The blog will run on standard MVC architecture, using node.js
                and Express to power the back end. The database is MongoDB.
                Currently the front end is simply Express-powered Jade HTML/CSS
                under the BootStrap framework, though there are plans to move it
                to an AngularJS or React.js powered single-page application.

                I am promising to work hard. Whether I succeed, I will have to
                update later. Regardless, I have been sending many messages and
                letters to some of the people I love, so they can't complain.
